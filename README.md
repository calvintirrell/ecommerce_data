# E-commerce Data
Analysis of e-commerce data from a real retail business based in the U.K.
Work on this project could include a range of models such as time series, classification or clustering.
The date range of the online only sales data is from January 2010 to September 2011 - so well over 1.5 years.

[This project idea is from this Kaggle competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
