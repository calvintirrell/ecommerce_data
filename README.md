# E-commerce Data
Analysis of e-commerce data from a real retail business based in the U.K.
Work on this project could include a range of models such as time series, classification or clustering.
The date range of the online only sales data is from January 2010 to September 2011 - so well over 1.5 years.

[This project idea is from this Kaggle competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

To view the actual Jupyter Lab that I have been working in - go to the 'notebooks' folder and select the file: 'ecomm_project.ipynb'.

This notebook is NOT a project with a final conclusion or summary.
This notebook IS an exploration of the e-commerce data along with things I've found to be useful and interesting (or not).

Each section will have a title or information in non-technical terms to provide context for the code below it.

Thanks for taking a look!
